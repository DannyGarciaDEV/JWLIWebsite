                <h3> Our History</h3>
                <p> The Japanese Women’s Leadership Initiative (JWLI) was founded in 2006 by three visionary women in
                    Boston, Massachusetts: Atsuko Toko Fish, Mary Lassen, and Catherine Crone Coburn. JWLI brings
                    emerging women leaders, referred to as the Fellows, from Japan to Boston to receive four weeks of
                    hands-on experience and training with successful nonprofit organizations in nonprofit management and
                    leadership development. During their stay in Boston, the Fellows will develop an Action Plan, which
                    will serve as a step-by-step roadmap to make their dreams of social change a reality. After
                    returning to Japan, the Fellows are expected to make a difference in their communities based on
                    their Action Plans. The purpose of this program is for the fellows to share the knowledge and
                    experience they acquired in Boston with other women and social sector leaders within Japan.

                </p>
                <p>The Fish Family Foundation, operating in conjunction with other Boston-based nonprofit organizations,
                    is administering JWLI in partnership with Simmons College School of Management’s Center for Gender
                    in Organizations.</p>
                <p> In 2010, thanks to the generous funding provided by the U.S. – Japan Foundation, JWLI expanded its
                    vision to hold public forums within Japan. Held in 2010, 2012 and 2013, these public forums provided
                    information about the nonprofit sector and the American approach to philanthropy with hopes to
                    inspire women to take leadership roles. The Forum Program reached hundreds of Japanese citizens,
                    advocating for their involvement in addressing the needs of Japanese society.</p>

                <p> Celebrating the 10th anniversary, JWLI hosted the Tokyo Summit at Tokyo American Club on October 18,
                    and it was a huge success. Nearly 40 women leaders and JWLI Fellows candidly explored the theme of
                    Women Leading Social Change in Japan with the audience of over 300 people. Mari Kuraishi, a founder
                    of Global Giving, gave us a powerful keynote speech sharing her journey to start the organization.
                    The Summit showcased JWLI’s 10-year impact by highlighting 10 alumnae and their achievements. Under
                    the theme of Women Leading Social Change in Japan, the Summit’s most important message to the
                    participants was to take action and be a leader to make positive social change in Japan.</p>

                <h3> Atsuko Toko Fish - Founder</h3>
                <p> Atsuko Toko Fish retired as a U.S.-Japan cross-cultural consultant, and is currently involved with
                    various social innovative movements
                    as a philanthropist. She is also a founding trustee of the Fish Family Foundation. To accelerate
                    social change by women leaders, Atsuko founded the Champion of Change Japan Award (CCJA) in 2017 and
                    is launching the JWLI Bootcamp in June, 2019. In the wake of 3.11, Atsuko established the Japanese
                    Disaster Relief Fund-Boston (JDRFB) to support immediate and mid-term recovery in Tohoku. Atsuko
                    visited the effected region several times to assess and evaluate the fast-changing needs of the
                    people and community. In the two years the fund was active for, JDRFB raised approximately $1
                    million and distributed 24 grants to 19
                    organizations and projects working directly in Tohoku. It has been reported by the grantees that
                    JDRFB’s $1 million grants were leveraged for $6 million of economic impact.</p>
